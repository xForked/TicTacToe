## How it was built

This project was generated entirely by **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)** (Anthropic's AI CLI tool) using a single prompt:

> *"make me a tic tac toe I can play on the web"*

No manual coding was done. Claude Code created the full single-file HTML/CSS/JS implementation, pushed it to GitHub, and wrote this README — all from the terminal.

### Stack

- Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- No frameworks, no dependencies
- Single file (`tictactoe.html`)
